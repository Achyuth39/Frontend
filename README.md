## Certainly! Here's a more organized format for the three commands in the Visual Studio Code editor and terminal to generate an SSH key for connecting GitHub and VSC locally:

# HTML Introduction

* HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
* HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
* HTML describes the structure of a Web page
* HTML consists of a series of elements
* HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
* HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.


## Example Explained

* The ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
* The ```<html>``` element is the root element of an HTML page
* The ```<head>``` element contains meta information about the HTML page
* The ```<title>``` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
* The ```<body>``` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
* The ```<h1>``` element defines a large heading
* The ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph
